# Navigation-Study
This project will serve to enhance our understanding of the effect, if any exists, of directional stimulation on participants’ spatial awareness when attempting to navigate through unfamiliar space and understand its environmental layout. Using a vibrating belt lined with tactors that indicates the direction of North (of the virtual world) at all times during the navigation process, the influence of a constant awareness of one’s spatial orientation will be studied. We are curious of their ability to quickly master unfamiliar environment. The purpose is to determine how this additional sense might provide additional information to assist people in more quickly and efficiently creating an internal map of their surroundings and how they might best get from point A to point B.
